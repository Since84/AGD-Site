However is this era of gizmos and gadgets, more is much more daunting than the simplicity of the past. Previously, the media consisted of the TV, radio, print publications and the mail. Today the Internet, social networks, satellite TV, cable TV, mobile phone applications, and digital airwaves make everything so confusing. This makes things really confusing for small business owners who want to advertise but don\\\'t know where to begin. Which is better? Which will provide better exposure and profit for my company? More, certainly have people more perplexed.</p>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>AGD helps to unravel some myths surrounding advertising, marketing and the many options available to them.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Myth #1 &ndash; <b>In order to get through to people I have to bombard them using every outlet available.</b>&nbsp;Effective and smart advertising should never &ldquo;bombard&rdquo; anyone. Effective advertising should be intelligent, memorable and compelling. It is not necessary to use every media outlet available. Not only is this a lofty task, but a very expensive one. In order to decide which avenue is best for your business you must understand your consumer. If your consumers are primarily the elderly, chances are that advertising on You Tube will not be that effective.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Myth #2 &ndash; <b>Consumers are so heavily inundated by the media that they have become immune to marketing.</b> If marketing did not work, corporate entities would not spend billions of dollars annually on advertising. While it is true that consumers do prefer to fast-forward through commercials or invest in items that profess to have less commercial breaks, marketing certainly does have an impact. The key to standing out amongst all the noise is establishing an effective strategy. Advertise where your patrons are likely to see you. If the majority of your clientele are teenagers, Facebook and You Tube would be better advertising options than the New York Times. Once you have chosen the best avenues to reach your clientele, make sure you develop an intelligent ad campaign that is sure to catch their eye. For example, if you are targeting seniors, it is not a good idea to use small font, lots of jargon and loud colors. The key is to speak to your audience.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Myth #3 &ndash; <b>If I have an ad displayed in a high traffic area such as a TV commercial, Google, etc., it will bring my company business.</b>&nbsp;Simply having an ad presence does not guarantee business. Where is your ad located? What does it look like? What does it say? Do your consumers use Google?&nbsp;Placement, positions, size, design and content are factors in the effectiveness of your ad campaign as well as where you choose to advertise. So you got an ad on TV, now what? Does your target market watch TV or the channel you have the commercial placed on? What about the programming during your ad? Smart advertising is not just simply making an appearance on &ldquo;the big screen&rdquo;.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Myth #4 &ndash; <b>My business can survive using &ldquo;free&rdquo; advertising.</b> Many small businesses choose not to advertise because they feel that with all the rage in social networks and hubs, they can get away with &ldquo;free&rdquo; marketing. While having a presence on Facebook, Yelp, Twitter, Google, may do some to get your name out there, it is not very effective as an advertising mechanism. A Facebook page does not guarantee a spike in business and setting up a business profile on Yelp will not ensure great reviews.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Myth #5 &ndash; <b>My Company is too small to embark on an advertising campaign.</b> No company is too small to advertise. Many small companies shy away from advertising because of the cost and because they are unsure of where to advertise. Marketing does not need to be a huge expenditure. Marketing takes on many forms and could be as simple as sending out a holiday card with a discount offer to your current customer base. Regardless of the size of your budget or company, marketing can be as simple or complicated as you would like it to be. Effective marketing will ensure your company&rsquo;s growth and success.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','news__20110505131317.jpg',NULL,NULL,1,NULL,'2011-05-26 16:21:59','2010-12-17 15:55:49'),(29,1045,'2011-03-08','New Website for Professional Massage Therapy','New Website',NULL,'<p>AGD designs website for local massage therapists.</p>','<p><span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt;\\\">Walnut Creek, CA - AG Design Group Inc., a graphic design and marketing firm specializing in branding, has developed a new website for Walnut Creek based massage spa, Professional Massage Therapy.

These are three things all business owners should know about their brand.</p>','<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt;\\\">Branding is a crucial must in today&rsquo;s business climate. Creating a business image and company identity is what sets businesses apart. While most business owners realize the importance of this pivotal step, some take the task lightly.</span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt;\\\">Not all branding is created equal. Simply having a logo does not necessarily ensure proper branding, and can do more harm than good. These are three things all business owners should know about their brand:</span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt;\\\">1.&nbsp;<b>Your Brand Should Target Your Ideal Clientele</b>: In the marketing industry, there is much ado about targeting a specific audience, reaching your consumers, and speaking to certain demographics. While this may be true, branding should speak to the clientele you wish to attract. If you wish to service big corporations or large companies, but are currently servicing small businesses, your branding should speak to corporate executives and reflect the caliber of a company they would likely work with. Working with a trained firm can give you insight into your audience&rsquo;s buying habits, likes, dislikes and psychological graphs. Understanding your ideal client is essential when developing a successful brand. </span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt;\\\">2. <b>Your Brand Reflects The Way You Conduct Business</b>: Your brand (logo, brochures, website, etc.) provides insight into your business operation and how you conduct business. The old adage, dress for success, could not ring any truer. Branding is the clothes one wears to the interview. Those who are rough around the edges rarely get hired for the VP position. If your company has a thrifty appearance or templated branding, then you attract clients who are expecting discount prices. Clients never walk into Starbucks and negotiate the price for a cup of coffee or ask for a discount on a bagel.&nbsp;In order to avoid this, your branding should reflect the goals of your company, who you hope to become and give the impression that you&rsquo;re established, credible and here to stay.</span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt;\\\">3. <b>Even The Best Branding Needs Marketing Strategy</b>: A good brand starts with a good logo that is applied consistently and constantly. However, even the best branding will not get your phone to ring. Simply having a stellar website and an artfully designed brochure will not generate business. Effective branding needs to be accompanied by an effective marketing strategy. Branding is simply the foundation from which to build upon. </span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt;\\\">AG Design Group Inc. has been creating successful brands and marketing strategies since 2006.

Oakland based Matches That Matter has introduced a different style of match making. Matches That Matter pairs compatible singles into groups who participate in community outreach activities. Singles can get to know each other while contributing something positive to the community. </span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size:10.0pt;\\\">AG Design Group has gained much notoriety in its field for its custom design styles, user interface, dynamic user experience and highly effective Content Management Systems. &ldquo;It is important that your main point of contact with your clients, your website, reflects your business perfectly.&rdquo; states Perlita Herrera, Communications Manager at AG Design Group. &ldquo;We believe that Matches That Matter&rsquo;s match&ndash;making strategy is truly unique. Our goal with this site was to develop a look and style that visually set Matches That Matter apart from other dating sites.&rdquo;</span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size:10.0pt;\\\">In order to draw the distinction between the Matches That Matter dating strategy versus conventional dating sites, AG Design Group developed a more personable user experience. The new design incorporates an easy, clear navigation and warm, inviting feel. &ldquo;It was really important to us that we work with an experienced firm,&rdquo; notes Odette Pollar, Founder and CEO of Matches That Matter. &ldquo;The staff at AG Design are professionals. We could rest assured knowing that design and development were being attended to, so that we could focus our energy on our clients.&rdquo; </span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size:10.0pt;\\\">Complete with a sleek color scheme, interactive dating game and a custom-developed Content Management System, AG Design has hit the mark with new Matches That Matter site.&nbsp;</span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size:10.0pt;\\\">Matches That Matter currently serves singles over 40 in the San Francisco Bay Area.

To commemorate the beginning of a new year, AG Design Group has launched their re-designed website. The design was treated with a more modern and jovial approach. The site also features recent projects, project samples and case studies. Follow them on <a href=\\\"http://www.facebook.com/agdesigngroup\\\">Facebook</a> to keep up with their latest activity and get insightful design and marketing tips.</span></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\\\"font-size: 10pt;\\\">In addition to a renovated website, AG Design Group has added several new faces to the team.

Last Spring, Goggle announced that page speed, or how quickly your web page loads, plays a role in web search ranking. Although at this point it doesn\\\'t affect your SEO ranking too much, don\\\'t be surprised if this criteria becomes more important in the near future. With so many web surfers looking for quick answers, web pages that have painstaking load times, may find themselves sinking lower and lower in the Google ranking.</p>\r\n<p>So what does this mean? Older sites that were coded using out-dated practices (like slices of background images) or some WordPress sites with slow load times will need to be recoded.

People have a million dollar idea, and we give them the competitive advantage by helping them look like a million bucks, so they can get funding for a million (or whatever investment amount they are targeting). By offering this package, startup companies can get a jump-start on their business and be well equipted to impress potential investors by looking professional and having all the tools for the &quot;WOW&quot; effect. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s one thing to tell an investor about an idea, and another to show them; and we&rsquo;ll make sure they are blown away by the designs.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Q: Why does AGD require the $7,500 deposit?</strong></div>\r\n<div>&#8232;A: All investors want to see that the founder spent some of their own money on their concept, we do as well. We want to make sure the company we invest our time in is serious and has &lsquo;skin in the game&rsquo; and a vested interest to push the company forward.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Q: Why is there a $500/mo fee?</strong></div>\r\n<div>&#8232;A: This is your repayment to us for our upfront investment into your company. We are investing well over 150 hours into your company upfront and are taking on risk. The $500/mo payment is a way we, as an investor, mitigate that risk and ensues we don&rsquo;t have total loss. This also creates the motivation to push forward in seeking funding, rather than sitting idle.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div><strong>Q: Are the terms negotiable?&nbsp;</strong></div>\r\n<div>&#8232;A: We evaluate every company independently of one another. &nbsp;This is something we address on a case-by-case basis.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div><strong>Q: What are the terms for the work you provide?&nbsp;</strong></div>\r\n<div>&#8232;A: We provide our standard terms sheet prior to executing a contract and agreement.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><strong>Q: Why do you invest all this time upfront and take on this risk?&#8232;</strong></div>\r\n<div>A: We invest this time upfront and do everything we can to get your business funded. We have a vested interest in your company, and when you get funded, we get paid out in full. Chances are, that when you get funded, you&rsquo;ll use us to complete the UI/UX and develop your full online product or application. As you grow, we grow with you and have the full scalability to support all of your marketing needs as well.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Q: Why don&rsquo;t you invest money instead of time?&#8232;</strong></div>\r\n<div>A: We&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of startups and know what it takes to get funded. If an investor can visualize what your product will look like, you&rsquo;re a step ahead. This is the best way we can ensure our investment is spent on delivering high quality material, taking the guessing away from the investors. Several of our clients have been funded and our designs were carried through to the final production.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><strong>Q: Do you have examples of Start-up Companies you\'ve worked with?</strong></div>\r\n<div>&#8232;A: Yes.
